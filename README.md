## 🎯 Project Vision

Invx is designed as a **multi-tenant SaaS platform** for small to mid-sized businesses to streamline their invoicing, billing, and customer management operations. This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of modern backend engineering practices and enterprise-grade architecture patterns.

### 🏢 Business Problem Statement

Modern SMBs struggle with fragmented invoicing solutions that don't scale with their growth. Invx aims to address this by providing:

- **Unified Invoice Management**: From creation to payment collection
- **Flexible Billing Models**: One-time, recurring, usage-based, and hybrid billing
- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Secure tenant isolation with flexible deployment options
- **Enterprise Integration**: APIs, webhooks, and third-party service integrations
- **Compliance Ready**: Tax calculations, audit trails, and regulatory reporting

### 🎨 Architecture Philosophy

This project demonstrates **modern backend engineering** through:

- 🏗️ **Domain-Driven Design** → Bounded contexts and rich domain models
- 🧅 **Clean Architecture** → Dependency inversion and testable design
- 📡 **Event-Driven Integration** → Asynchronous, resilient service communication
- 🏢 **Multi-Tenancy Patterns** → Scalable tenant isolation strategies
- 📊 **CQRS & Event Sourcing** → Optimized read/write models with audit trails
- 🔍 **Observability First** → Comprehensive monitoring and tracing
- 🐳 **Cloud-Native Design** → Containerized microservices architecture

## 🚀 Getting Started (Development Setup)

### Prerequisites
- [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [Docker & Docker Compose](https://www.docker.com/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) (or run via Docker)

### Current Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ahmed-ismail-xy/invx-platform.git
cd invx-platform

# Start infrastructure services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.infrastructure.yml up -d

# Run the Invoice service (currently in development)
cd src/Services/Invoice
dotnet run
```

**Note**: Full orchestration with docker-compose and Kubernetes will be available as more services are implemented.
